      Templates a `select * from x` CTE. Used to help improve readability when all references are listed
      by line at the top of the file.

      This macro intentionally does not provide the ability to modify the select statement since it is usually
      more appropriate to push the logic up the dependency graph into a well defined model.

      Regarding the performance concerns of using blanket `select *`s everywhere, see
